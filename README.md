# To Run Locally:

1. Download the files (excluding Extra Datasets folder) into one folder
2. Start a live server from index.html

# Direction Change:

Since my static visualization, I changed my datasets as well as my vis design. My original design (draggable bubbles that change size when clicked) was too complex for me to successfully implement, and I felt that the data would not be sufficient if presented any other way.

My new dataset (and accompanying poem) focus on mass shootings, pulling from the updated (up to 2023) Mother Jones dataset (https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/). Within the Extra Datasets folder, the file "MassShootings_Updated.csv" is my cleaned version of this dataset, along with some additional columns. The new "AR-15" column pulls directly from the existing "weapon_details" column, and the new "outcome" and "military_background" columns pulling from the existing "summary" column.

Though it took quite a bit of cleaning, this data has much more insight to give than my previous dataset (Percent of Female Graduates by Field). Several visualizations I did not have space to include can be inferred from the files included in Extra Datasets. With varying approaches to solving our mass shootings issue, I felt that visualizing the info we do have would be the best way to move forward towards meaningful change.
